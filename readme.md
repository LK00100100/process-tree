This tree data structure is used for information processing.

## Running
Uses python 2.7. I recommend using Conda to setup the Python virtual environment.
No external libraries.

Check the unit tests. I use pycharm to run the test folder. In pycharm, right click that folder and run tests.

## TODO
- Auto-recalc parents on operation change?
- Note: Maybe calc this node and the parent? if so, rename set_op func to set_op_and_recalc
